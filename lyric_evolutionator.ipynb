But I recently listened to a list of the current Top 100 Hip Hop songs, and the lyrics appeared so devoid of content, so obsessed with booty and bling, so stinkin' crude, that it got me thinking: am I just old and out of touch, or has Hip Hop really changed in its content?  This project is one way of trying to answer the question."
